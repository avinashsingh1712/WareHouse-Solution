# WareHouse-Solution

# Technologies Used
The assignment has been developed as a maven project using Java/SpringBoot/Rest and ORM API.

#Assumptions
As the assignment description was short, there are few assumptions taken during development and will be detailed during the discussion.

1. There are a few TODO added in the code for considering future enhancements.
2. Not removing the products instead of Marking them as non-buyable in case there are articles missing.
3. As there is no description of the number of articles for a product, it has been assumed each article will have 1 quantity.
4. For uploading the JSON files, assumed that files will be either on any network drive or will be handled through topics using pub/sub.
5. Together with getting products and remove products functionality, added another API to check if the product is available and fetch all the articles.
